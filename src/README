ABOUT:

pythonOCC is a computer program whose purpose is to provide a complete set
of python bindings for OpenCasacde library.

BUILD:

You can either build pythonOCC from the SWIG files that come with the distribution (case A)
or generate your own wrapper (case B).

* Case A: build wrapper from SWIG files included in the distribution

Requirements:
- Visual Studio 2003 or higher (Windows only)
- g++ (Linux)
- Swig 1.3.33 or higher (for Windwos users, the swig.exe file must be added to the PATH environment
variable).
- OpenCascade 6.3.0 proper install

Step 1:
extract the content of pythonOCC-md0.1

Step 2: 
cd /pythonOCC/src
python setup.py build -cmsvc (Windows)
sudo python setup.y build (Linux)

Step 3:
python setup.py build install (Windows)
sudo setup.py build install (Linux)

Step 5: check installation. From a python prompt, just enter 'from OCC import *'. You should not
get any error. 

* Case B: build your own wrapper
Requirements:
- Visual Studio 2003 or higher (Windows only)
- Swig 1.3.36 or higher (for Windwos users, the swig.exe file must be added to the PATH environment
variable).
- OpenCascade. Release 6.3.0 was used to generate the binaries. Older release may work as well,
but it's not tested.
- pygccxml 1.0 and Py++ 1.0

Step 1:
extract the content of pythonOCC-1.0pre2 

Step 2:
python setup.py build -cmsvc -generate_swig (Windows)
sudo python setup.py build -generate_swig (Windows)

Note: paths are defined in the environment.py script.
Windows users should modify only the 'GCCXMLPATH'.
Linux users should also modify the 'OCC_LIB' path.

Following steps are the same than the previous Case A.
