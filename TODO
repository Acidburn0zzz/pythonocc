Wrapping:

    Some arguments in for instance the ShapeFix module have non-standard arguments:

		In [8]: print sfs.FixShellMode() # sfs = ShapeFix_Solid()
		 <Swig Object of type 'Standard_Integer *' at 0x7f4ea40> 
		 
		The best fix would be that you simple call sfs.FixShellMode(True) evidently
		
0.4 release:

    *   Quartz / Carbon bindings for the OCC OSX binaries, such that we can get rid of X11
    *   SMESH wrapped
    *   QT support via PyQT
    *   Display module threaded, such that it remains interactive while the python interpreter is doing something else
        That should be a godsend while debugging ;')
        

0.5 release:

    *   Manipulators
        It would be really cool if there is a manipulator such that the tangent over a curve or surface can be evaluated
