Wrapping:

    Some arguments in for instance the ShapeFix module have non-standard arguments:

		In [8]: print sfs.FixShellMode() # sfs = ShapeFix_Solid()
		 <Swig Object of type 'Standard_Integer *' at 0x7f4ea40> 
		 
		The best fix would be that you simple call sfs.FixShellMode(True) evidently
		

0.4 release:
    target date: mid October

    *   SMESH wrapped ( Joachim Zettler joins in on this effort )

    *   QT support via PyQT ( WX & QT backend for Display module )

    *   Display module threaded, such that it remains interactive while the python interpreter is doing something else
        That should be a godsend while debugging ;')

    *   PAF framework refactored with descriptors ( easier to extend / inherit )

0.5 release:
    target date: mid December

    *   Quartz / Carbon bindings for the OCC OSX binaries, such that we can get rid of X11

    *   Manipulators
        It would be really cool if there is a manipulator such that the tangent over a curve or surface can be evaluated
        
0.6 release:
    target date: mid February
    
    *   ???
